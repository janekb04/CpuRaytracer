# CpuRaytracer

A multithreaded CPU raytracer. Made for educational purposes. Made thanks to [Raytracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/).

![Showcase](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janekb04/CpuRaytracer/master/showcase.png "Showcase")

Currently the following materials have been implemented:
 - Lambertian (diffuse)
 - Metallic (specular)
 - Emmissive (light)
 - Portal (like in that game)
 - Dielectric (glass)

 Some glitches have occured along the way, while implementing. If you're interested in seeing those, some images are in the `glitches` folder.
